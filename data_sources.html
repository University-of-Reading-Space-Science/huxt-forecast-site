        <h1>Data Sources</h1>
        <section class="content-section">
            <p>Our forecasts are built upon diverse, high-quality data sources. We carefully curate and quality-control all input data to ensure the reliability of our products.</p>

            <h2>Observational Data</h2>
            <p>We integrate observations from multiple platforms including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground-based measurement networks</li>
                <li>Satellite remote sensing systems</li>
                <li>Research vessel observations</li>
                <li>Automated monitoring stations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Model Reanalysis</h2>
            <p>Historical reanalysis datasets provide consistent long-term records that are essential for model training and validation. We use internationally recognized reanalysis products from leading research centers.</p>

            <h2>Real-time Data Streams</h2>
            <p>Our systems ingest real-time data from operational networks to ensure forecast initialization reflects the latest conditions. Data quality control procedures are applied to all incoming observations.</p>

            <h2>Data Partners</h2>
            <p>We collaborate with national and international data providers to ensure comprehensive coverage. We acknowledge and thank our data partners for their essential contributions.</p>

            <h2>Data Quality</h2>
            <p>All data undergo rigorous quality control before being used in our forecasting systems. This includes automated checks for consistency, completeness, and physical plausibility.</p>

            <h2>Data Availability</h2>
            <p>Where possible, we provide links to the original data sources to support transparency and enable independent verification of our work.</p>
