        <section class="content-section">
            <p>
                Below we detail the sources of the data we use to construct the boundary conditions of the HUXt forecasts.
            </p>

            <h2> Ambient Solar Wind Structure</h2>
            <h3>The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model</h3>
            <p>
                The WSA model is widely used in both research and operational space weather forecasting to estimate the
                ambient solar wind structure in the low heliosphere <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/hgss-8-21-2017">[1]</a>.
                WSA is an empirical model that relates the structure of the coronal magnetic field to the solar
                wind flow speed. It takes as an input a synoptic map of the photospheric magnetic field structure, such
                as those produced by the National Solar Observatory's <a href="https://gong.nso.edu/">Global Oscillation
                Network Group (GONG)</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>CorTom</h3>
            <p>
                Professor Huw Morgan and his colleagues at the University of Aberystwyth developed a coronal rotational
                tomography method (CorTom) to estimate the density and flow speed of the solar wind in the upper
                corona and low heliosphere <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023SW003448">[2]</a>. CorTom is applied to
                the STEREO SECCHI Coronagraph data to estimate the solar wind flow speed at 8 solar radii, and these
                speeds are used as an inner boundary condition to HUXt, after they have been mapped to 21.5 solar radii.
            </p>
            <h3>BRaVDA</h3>
            <p>
                The Burger Radial Variational Data Assimilation (BRaVDA) scheme is a 4DVar data assimilation scheme that
                estimates the structure of the solar wind flow in the low heliosphere
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020SW002698">[3]</a>. BRaVDA assimilates in-situ solar wind speed
                observations with model estimates of the solar wind speed structure, such as those provided by the WSA
                model. Following Turner et al. (2025) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2025SW004559">[4]</a>, we use
                BRaVDA output generated from assimilating the real-time solar wind speed observations from the L1
                lagrange point with output from the WSA model.
            </p>

            <h2> Cone CME parameters</h2>
            <h3> NASA M2M Cone Files</h3>
            <p>
                The NASA Moon-to-Mars (M2M) Space Weather Analysis Office has forecasters that produce cone CME fits to
                coronagraph observations to enable real-time space weather forecasting. These are made publicly
                available by NASA's Coordinated Community Modelling Center (CCMC) via the <a href="https://kauai.ccmc.gs
                fc.nasa.gov/DONKI/">Database of Notifications, Knowledge, and Information (DONKI)</a> catalogue.
            </p>
            <h3>ACME</h3>
            <p>
                Professor Huw Morgan and his colleagues at the University of Aberystwyth developed an Automatic CME
                (ACME) characterisation methodology. ACME is applied to the STEREO SECCHI Coronagraph data to
                automatically identify and characterise the spatial structure and flow of CMEs in the low heliosphere.
                From this, estimates of the cone CME paramters are derived which are then used with HUXt.
