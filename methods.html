        <h1>Methods</h1>
        <section class="content-section">
            <p>Our forecasting approach combines established scientific methods with continuous innovation. We maintain transparency in our methodologies to support scientific reproducibility.</p>

            <h2>Modeling Framework</h2>
            <p>We employ a multi-model ensemble approach that combines outputs from several independent forecasting systems. This approach reduces systematic biases and provides more robust predictions.</p>

            <h2>Data Assimilation</h2>
            <p>Our systems incorporate real-time observations using advanced data assimilation techniques. This ensures that forecasts are initialized with the most accurate representation of current conditions.</p>

            <h2>Validation and Verification</h2>
            <p>All forecast products undergo rigorous validation against historical observations. We publish regular verification statistics to maintain accountability and track performance improvements.</p>

            <h2>Uncertainty Quantification</h2>
            <p>We provide uncertainty estimates for all forecasts through ensemble techniques. Understanding forecast uncertainty is essential for informed decision-making.</p>

            <h2>Publications</h2>
            <p>Detailed descriptions of our methods are available in peer-reviewed scientific literature. We believe in open science and make our methodological documentation publicly accessible.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
            <p>Our methods are continuously evaluated and refined based on performance metrics and advances in scientific understanding.</p>
